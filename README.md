# Fleeting's CamJam-EduKit Code

This repo houses the code for myself and my kids while playing with the awesome [CamJam EduKits](http://camjam.me/?page_id=618). Some will be following along with the worksheets while others will be playing with other ideas using what is in the kit.

If you or your kids are looking to get into playing with a Raspberry Pi, I highly recommend getting both CamJam kits. They are priced low but includes enough pieces to get a good grasp on using Python and GPIO. I also recommend diving into the Python course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/).
